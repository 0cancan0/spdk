# Configuration syntax:
# Spaces at head of line are deleted, other spaces are as separator
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and not evaluated.
# Lines ending with '\' are concatenated with the next line.
# Bracketed keys are section keys grouping the following value keys.
# Number of section key is used as a tag number.
#  Ex. [TargetNode1] = TargetNode section key with tag number 1

  # Users can restrict work items to only run on certain cores by
  #  specifying a ReactorMask.  Default ReactorMask mask is defined as
  #  -c option in the 'ealargs' setting at beginning of file nvmf_tgt.c.
  #ReactorMask 0x00FF

  # Tracepoint group mask for spdk trace buffers
  # Default: 0x0 (all tracepoint groups disabled)
  # Set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to enable all tracepoint groups.
  #TpointGroupMask 0x0

# This next section defines NVMf protocol specific global options
[Nvmf]
  # Set the maximum number of NVMf logical controller sessions allowed
  # for each subsystem provisioned below.  The default value (1) is used if
  # not set here.
  #MaxSessionsPerSubsystem 1

  # Set the maximum number of NVMf per-controller connections [admin_q + io_q(s)]
  MaxConnectionsPerSession 4

  # Set the global default maximum queue depth to a value less than the
  # default (128).  This value used for initial global pool allocation of
  # QP Rx/Tx descriptors and staging buffers.  The actual queue depth
  # used is negotiated during connection establishment, the remote
  # initiator having the opportunity to specify a smaller value.
  #MaxQueueDepth 128

# NVMe Device Whitelist
# Users may specify which NVMe devices to claim by their PCI
# domain, bus, device, and function. The format is dddd:bb:dd.f, which is
# the same format displayed by lspci or in /sys/bus/pci/devices. The second
# argument is a "name" for the device that can be anything. The name
# is referenced later in the Subsystem section.
#
# Alternatively, the user can specify ClaimAllDevices. All
# NVMe devices will be claimed and named Nvme0, Nvme1, etc.
