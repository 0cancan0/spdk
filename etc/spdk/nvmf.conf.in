# NVMf Target Configuration File
#
# Please write all parameters using ASCII.
# The parameter must be quoted if it includes whitespace.
#
# Configuration syntax:
# Leading whitespace is ignored.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Lines ending with '\' are concatenated with the next line.
# Bracketed ([]) names define sections

[Global]
  # Users can restrict work items to only run on certain cores by
  #  specifying a ReactorMask.  Default ReactorMask mask is defined as
  #  -c option in the 'ealargs' setting at beginning of file nvmf_tgt.c.
  #ReactorMask 0x00FF

  # Tracepoint group mask for spdk trace buffers
  # Default: 0x0 (all tracepoint groups disabled)
  # Set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to enable all tracepoint groups.
  #TpointGroupMask 0x0

  # syslog facility
  LogFacility "local7"

# Define NVMf protocol global options
[Nvmf]
  # Set the maximum number of submission and completion queues per session.
  # Setting this to '8', for example, allows for 8 submission and 8 completion queues
  # per session.
  MaxConnectionsPerSession 4

  # Set the maximum number of outstanding I/O per queue.
  #MaxQueueDepth 128

# NVMe Device Whitelist
# Users may specify which NVMe devices to claim by their PCI
# domain, bus, device, and function. The format is dddd:bb:dd.f, which is
# the same format displayed by lspci or in /sys/bus/pci/devices. The second
# argument is a "name" for the device that can be anything. The name
# is referenced later in the Subsystem section.
#
# Alternatively, the user can specify ClaimAllDevices. All
# NVMe devices will be claimed and named Nvme0, Nvme1, etc.

# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Exactly 1 Controller directive.
