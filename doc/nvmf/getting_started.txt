\section nvmf_prereqs Prerequisites

To build nvmf there are some package dependencies.

Fedora:
\verbatim
dnf install libibverbs-devel librdmacm-devel
\endverbatim

Ubuntu:
\verbatim
apt-get install libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev
\endverbatim

Then build SPDK with the NVMf target enabled, either by editing CONFIG
to enable CONFIG_RDMA or enabling it on the `make` command line:

\verbatim
make CONFIG_RDMA=y <other config parameters>
\endverbatim

\section nvmf_config Configuring NVMf

An NVMf specific configuration file is used to configure, or 'provision',
the NVMf target. This file defines the following:

 - general application parameters
 - global NVMf parameters
 - ports that define local RDMA interface ports the nvmf target will
     use for network access
 - initiator groups with names and addresses to allow access to nvmf target
     subsystems
 - list of NVMe HW device candidates to share via NVMf
 - NVMf target subsystem(s) that define the provision mappings between remote
     initiator groups and local target ports, and NVMe device
     namespaces

An example nvmf configuration file included with this package at
`etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.in`.

You must edit a version of this file for use in your environment and copy it
to /usr/local/etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.  Alternatively, you may also specify the
configuration file explicitly using `-c /path/to/nvmf.conf` when starting `nvmf_tgt`.

The `Port` and `Host` sections must be updated in all cases to
match the IP addresses in your network environment.

The `Nvme` section must also be updated with a the list of NVMe devices
that will be exported.  Each device is identified by a PCI bus, device, and function.
The NVMf target will display a list of NVMe devices discovered
in the system.  This information can then be used to select the list of devices
to populate this configuration file section.
